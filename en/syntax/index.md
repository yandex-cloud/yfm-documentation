# Syntax

The Yandex Flavored Markdown syntax is based on [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/) and has been supplemented with unique elements from other markup languages and template engines.

To format text, the following is used:

* [Basic markup](./base.md)
* [Lists](./lists.md)
* [GFM](./tables/gfm.md) and [multiline tables](./tables/multiline.md)
* [Notes](./notes.md)
* [Cuts and tabs](./cuts-tabs.md)
* [Links](./links.md)
* [Media](./media.md)
* [Code snippets](./code.md)
* [Comments and metadata](./meta.md)
* [Variables](./vars.md)

In addition to the items included in the package, [additional features](./additional.md) are available. They can be added using [plugins for markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:markdown-it-plugin).
